# WJoy-foohid

## Public service announcement

Please note that **this is not an usable version** of
[WJoy-foohid](https://github.com/JustinBis/wjoy-foohid) project (or [WJoy
project](https://github.com/alxn1/wjoy) for that matter).  I'm converting this
to something that actually has very little to do with the Wii controller.

## Description from old README

WJoy allows you to use Wii controllers as native gamepads on OS X.

The following controllers are supported

- Wii Remote
    - Nunchuck
    - Classic Controller
- Wii U Pro Controller
- TODO: List the rest

This project is a fork of the original (now unsupported) project and uses
foohid as the driver.

## Quick Start

1. Download and install the latest release of foohid:
   https://github.com/unbit/foohid/releases/latest

2. Download and run the latest release of WJoy-foohid:
   https://github.com/JustinBis/wjoy-foohid/releases/latest

3. Ensure that bluetooth is enabled and then click the wiimote icon on the menu
   bar

4. Click "start discovery" and then hit the red sync button on your Wii Remote
   or other accessory

5. Once connected, your controller is ready to be used in any games that
   support native gamepads. Enjoy!

## Wii U Pro Controller Analog Stick Calibration

WJoy will now automatically calibrate the Wii U Pro Controller analog sticks on
the fly so that they reach 100% of the analog stick range rather than being
stuck around 60-70% range. To calibrate the sticks, simply move them in a few
full circles so that WJoy can detect the range of motion for each stick.

Thanks to [Kametrixom](https://github.com/Kametrixom) for this fix.

## Why foohid?

In OS X El Capitan (version 10.11), Apple added [System Integrity Protection
(AKA "rootless"
mode)](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/193368/what-is-the-rootless-feat
ure-in-el-capitan-really) as a security feature. Among other things, this
feature prevents the operating system from running unsigned kernel extensions
(kexts). The original WJoy project included an unsigned kext to provide a
virtual HID for each connected wiimote and thus the original project no longer
works on modern versions of OS X.

Thankfully, you can still run kexts signed by Apple or by approved developers.
That's where foohid comes in. foohid is a signed kext that allows programs to
create virtual HID devices on demand -- exactly what we need. With foohid
installed, we can use WJoy without having to disable important security
features on the operating system.
